<h2 style="font-size:140%">About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Angel B. Fernández and  
I'm a Baruch College graduate with a BBA in
International Marketing. Since graduating I've worked in various roles from clerical to PR. Though I sought after more engaging  opportunities that will constantly expand
my knowledge and skill set to adapt to the current tech-heavy environment and
dynamic digital future.
</p>
<p> This journey lead me to Digital Marketing and COOP, where I developed my standing in the Digital
Marketing field by acquiring fundamental digital skills as a Digital Marketing apprentice. After COOP, I took a Data Analytics course at General assembly
to further strengthen my analytical skills. And thanks to these experiences, I was able to peruse a role at
iProspect as a Display Associate.
</p>
<p>
In the role I was Collaborating in the development, maintenance and execution of various Display campaigns. As well as assisting with the maintenance of various reporting docs, such as budget plans, insight reporting, trafficking, and billing reconciliation to ensure that all campaign objectives/goals were met. Along the journey, I grew an interest in trying new opportunities outside of marketing. Where I’ll able to contribute my skills/knowledge and further grow and develop them to take on challenging and interesting projects.
</p>
<p>
Most recently I was volunteering my afternoons at COOP Leading a group of recent grads through coaching, training, and encouragement as they transition into careers in Digital Marketing. Though growing further away from marketing I still enjoyed helping others find their path. In fact while working on a client project with my students, I began to grow interest in the coding and behing the scenes of a webpage. And since having some background with SQL, I began to make connections with how things sort of worked. 
</p>
<p>The problem was that I didn't know how to even begin learning Web Development. I knew going back to school was out the question Also attempted to learn on my own to no avail. So I began doing research and found out about <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFclK4x_9TgJDj2wBaXair9lrKyKSonGekK9I86gIWYCZO2g/closedform" target="_blank"
>CUNY Tech Prep</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Through CUNY Tech Prep I learned about various programs but only one stood out to me and that was
<a href="http://www.theknowledgehouse.org/" target="_blank"
>The Knowledge House</a>. TKH stood out for various reasons:
<ul>
  <li>I remmeber the panel at the 2nd Bronx Tech Summit where Jerelyn spoke about TKH. </li>
  <li>They are a Bronx native organization that seeks to empower the community through technology and entrepreneurship.</li>
  <li>The Web Dev Innovation Fellowship feels like the right program to prepare me with the neccesarry up-to-date knowledge/tools to persue a career in tech.</li>
</ul>  
If chosen to take part in the Innovation Fellowship, I will do evertying in my part to learn all that is required to suceed.
